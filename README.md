# Space-Time Model

This project attempts to create a space-time diagram to model the pickup and delivery of packages in an area.

The General Modeling Network Specification (GMNS) project by Volpe/FHWA in partnership with Zephyr Foundation is a tool with which humans and machines can understand routable road network files. Read more about the system and file formats here: https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS

The Network EXplorer for Traffic Analysis (NeXTA) Graphical User Interface for General Modeling Network Specification (GMNS), also known as NeXTA-GMNS, uses the GMNS technology to visualize complex traffic flow dynamics.

Mr. Yongxiang (John) Zhang, Ph.D. Candidate at Southwest Jiaotong University and Dr. Xuesong (Simon) Zhou at Arizona State University use the NeXTA-GMNS approach to visualize transportation in 2D space as a function of time. It uses Python to read the data in NeXTA-GMNS files and converts it to a graph. Read more here: https://github.com/YXZhangSWJTU/space-time-diagram_gmns

Goals of the space-time model in this project (building upon projects described above):
#may change as progress is made
1. model pickup and delivery of packages along a supply chain
2. help researchers and students learn about and optimize for transportation planning
