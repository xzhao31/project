# Learning how to use tensorflow with python
Tensorflow is software library to develop and train neural networks in machine learning applications. Learn more about it here: https://www.tensorflow.org/ . This project will use the Python API to develop a simple neural network.

## Coding Environment
We will be using Google Colaboratory for this project. It is based on the Jupyter Notebook environment, but does not require installation of Jupyter notebook in order to use. It is like having a Notebook on Google Drive. First make sure you have a Google Account. Your notebooks will be available at https://colab.research.google.com/ . To get acquainted with Google Colab, review the following short document: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb

## Example: MNIST
You should be familiar with machine learning basics. The standard ML problem is based on the MNIST dataset, and attempts to extract digital numbers from handwriting. It has 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Now, to get acquainted with this basic Tensorflow example on Colab, review the following document: https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb .

## Example: 

Now, we'll begin to create our own files. Again, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and create a new notebook. You can store it in your Google Drive or Github.
