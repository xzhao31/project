## Installing it
We will be using Google Colaboratory for this project. It is based on the Jupyter Notebook environment, but does not require installation of Jupyter notebook in order to use. It is like having a Notebook on Google Drive. First make sure you have a Google Account. Your notebooks will be available at https://colab.research.google.com/ .

To get acquainted with Google Colab, review the following short document: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb

Now, to get acquainted with a basic Tensorflow example on Colab, review the following document: https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb

Now, we'll begin to create our own files. Again, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and create a new notebook. You can store it in your Google Drive or a github.
